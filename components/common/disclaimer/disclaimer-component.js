          promotional material in any respect. The report is not intended to provide accounting,

          The RMI seeks evidence of companiesâ€™ policies and practices on economic, environmental,
          social and governance (EESG) issues, but does not seek to measure the actual outcomes
          achieved on EESG issues. Results are based only on evidence sourced from the public domain
          or provided by companies as open data. Whilst this information is believed to be reliable,
          no guarantee can be given that it is accurate or complete, nor does it preclude the possibility
          that policies and practices may exist, but which the RMI has not been able to consider for
          purposes of assessment. In this respect, the results of the low-scoring companies do not
          necessarily reflect a lack of relevant policies and practices; as they may be due to a lack
          of public reporting by the companies, limitations in accessing information, and/or any
          difficulties in accessing the RMI company portal.
              </p>

          It should be noted that, prior to publication, all companies in the Index were invited to
          check the factual accuracy of the contextual data and evidence upon which the Index is based
          and to review company information in the RMI document library.
